# ⚔️ HAHK Token: The Blockchain Guillotine for Dirty Roommates  
## "HAHK (Haddi Alag Kar Denge) Token" (Next-level threat for stinkers)

### Tagline: "Shower skip kiya? HAHK se ETH kaat ke dikha denge!"

**"Roommate hasn't showered in 3 days? Their ETH balance is about to feel the same stench."**  

## 🔥 The Filthy Truth  
Every shared living space has that *one degenerate* who treats hygiene like a suggestion. Traditional shaming doesn't work. WhatsApp groups flood with complaints. Landlords ignore the crisis. **The world needed a decentralized solution.**  

Enter **HAHK Token** (Haddi Alag Kar Denge Token) - where blockchain meets bathroom accountability.  

## ⚡ Why Judges Will Care  
This isn't just another "me-too" DeFi project. We weaponize:  
- **Smart Contract Shame** - On-chain shower logs (immutable proof of laziness)  
- **Staked ETH Penalties** - Skip showers → fund the cleanest roommate  
- **7-Day Purification Wars** - Winner takes the stinkers' crypto  

## 🛠️ Tech That Doesn't Stink  
```solidity
[ Ethereum | Solidity | React | Supabase | Sepolia Testnet ]
```  
*"More reliable than your roommate's shower schedule"*  

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. **Stake ETH** - Lock funds as hygiene collateral  
2. **Log Showers** - Mint your cleanliness NFT (yes, really)  
3. **Enforce Justice** - After 7 days, the cleanest claims the pool  

## 💀 Differentiator? We Bring Violence  
Others build "friendly reminder apps". **We built:**  
- A **public stink leaderboard**  
- **Auto-slashing** of ETH for offenders  
- **Emergency Shower Airdrops** (SOS alerts to roommates)  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hahk-token.git
npm install
npm run dev
```  
*Warning: May cause sudden improvement in roommate behavior*
